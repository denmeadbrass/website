Today's post is written with a great deal of sadness and difficulty. Unfortunately Denmead Brass have come to the decision to suspend our rehearsals until further notice in light of recent health advice issued by the government. We implement these measures to keep the health and wellbeing of our community the number one priority. Keep safe, and keep making music - Denmead Brass
